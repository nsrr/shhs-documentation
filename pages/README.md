# About

The Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) is a multi-center cohort study implemented by the National Heart Lung & Blood Institute to determine the cardiovascular and other consequences of sleep-disordered breathing. It tests whether sleep-related breathing is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, all cause mortality, and hypertension.  In all, 6,441 men and women aged 40 years and older were enrolled between November 1, 1995 and January 31, 1998 to take part in SHHS Visit 1. During exam cycle 3 (January 2001- June 2003), a second polysomnogram (SHHS Visit 2) was obtained in 3,295 of the participants. CVD Outcomes data were monitored and adjudicated by parent cohorts between baseline and 2011. More than 130 manuscripts have been published investigating predictors and outcomes of sleep disorders.

## EEG Spectral Analysis

As part of the NSRR's effort to explore the SHHS data in more detail, EEG spectral analysis was performed. Read more about the [methods, validation, and results for the NSRR EEG spectral analysis efforts](:pages_path:/12-eeg-spectral-analysis.md). [Summary datasets are available](:files_path:/datasets/eeg-spectral-analysis) and the [included variables can be browsed here](https://www.sleepdata.org/datasets/shhs/variables?folder=Spectral+Analysis).

## Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Analysis

There are [summary datasets available](:files_path:/datasets/hrv-analysis) and the [included variables can be browsed here](https://www.sleepdata.org/datasets/shhs/variables?folder=HRV+Analysis).

## Methods in Biostatistics with R

NSRR user Ciprian Crainiceanu and colleagues wrote an E-book titled [*Methods in Biostatistics with R*](https://leanpub.com/biostatmethods) that uses a subset of SHHS data for many coding examples. The book-specific dataset is [available here for download](:files_path:/biostatistics-with-r).
