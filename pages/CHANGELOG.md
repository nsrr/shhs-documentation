### April 16, 2014

- Added [Dataset Introduction](:pages_path:/3-dataset-introduction.md) that describes the SHHS dataset that currently lives in the NSRR. Future dataset updates will be made when SHHS is available in [NHLBI's BioLINCC resource](https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/home/).

### February 10, 2014

- Added [tutorials](:pages_path:/tutorials) that cover Browsing Documentation, and Downloading EDFs.

### December 16, 2013

- The [Technical Notes on SHHS1](:pages_path:/4-equipment-shhs1.md) page has been updated with images and a table of sampling rates.

### December 12, 2013

- The complete [SHHS Manual of Operations](:pages_path:/mop/6-00-mop-toc.md) has been added.

### December 11, 2013

- The [SHHS1 EDF Annotations](:files_path:/annotations-shhs1) are now available in the file downloads area.
  - These annotations match up with the [SHHS1 polysomnograms](:files_path:/edf-shhs1) provided in EDF format.
  - You can open the SHHS1 EDFs and Annotations using the [sleepdata.org EDF Viewer](:tools_path:/sleep-portal-viewer).

### December 10, 2013

- We have added equipment documentation for the SHHS1 and SHHS2 visits, along with downloadable annotated data collection forms for SHHS1.

### December 3, 2013

- The SHHS data dictionary is now searchable on [sleepdata.org/collection](/collection?d=shhs). Browse around, explore variables across datasets, and request access to receive a download of the SHHS dataset!

### November 18, 2013

- Today we deposited 6,325 de-identified SHHS1 visit EDFs to the dataset.

### November 5, 2013

- We added the complete list of [variables](/collection?d=shhs) and domains based on the [v0.1.0 tag](https://github.com/sleepepi/shhs-data-dictionary/tree/v0.1.0) of the SHHS data dictionary.
- A notable variable we'd like to highlight is [rdi3p](/collection?d=shhs&s=rdi3p).
    - Commonly used index composed of all [central](/collection?d=shhs&s=central+3%25) and [obstructive](/collection?d=shhs&s=obstructive+3%25) apneas with at least 3% oxygen desaturation over the [total sleep time](/collection?d=shhs&s=slpprdp).


### October 23, 2013

- The SHHS1 dataset is currently being curated and finalized and will soon be available here: [sleepdata.org/datasets/shhs](:datasets_path:/shhs)
