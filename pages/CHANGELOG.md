- We added the complete list of [variables](/collection) and domains based on the [v0.1.0 tag](https://github.com/sleepepi/shhs-data-dictionary/tree/v0.1.0) of the SHHS data dictionary.
- A notable variable we'd like to highlight is [rdi3p](/collection?s=rdi3p).
    - Commonly used index composed of all [central](/collection?s=central+3%25) and [obstructive](/collection?s=obstructive+3%25) apneas with at least 3% oxygen desaturation over the [total sleep time](/collection?s=slpprdp).
