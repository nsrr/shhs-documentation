## 6.2.8 Dealing with ambiguous respiratory events

<u>If changes in amplitude are reduced by < 30%,</u> but a ≥ 10 s. period of a clearly discernible reduction in the amplitude of respiratory signals from baseline is observed, then score events when:

- they occur as part of a series of events (that do meet the 30% reduction criteria) ([ResFigures](:pages_path:/mop/6-AA-mop-list-of-illustrations.md) 7a, 7n, and 7o).
- they are associated with desaturations of at least 2% ([ResFigures](:pages_path:/mop/6-AA-mop-list-of-illustrations.md) 7b, 7m, 7p).

<u>Apneas/hypopneas immediately following large breaths or movements</u> are not scored, unless they are part of the cycle (there are other respiratory events before and following). Such isolated events may be “sighs” or artifact  ([ResFigures](:pages_path:/mop/6-AA-mop-list-of-illustrations.md) 7c).   When such an event is noted after a movement/large breath and appears to “trigger” a series of events, the first respiratory event is not scored (unless apneas/hypopneas were scored before the movement/large breath)  ([ResFigure](:pages_path:/mop/6-AA-mop-list-of-illustrations.md) 7d and 7e).

<u>Determining whether to score one long event or two short events</u> (i.e., after an initial decrease in amplitude of a breathing signal, there is some increase, but not to baseline, and then a fall again): In these cases, the oxygen saturation channel will be checked to determine whether one or more than one event should be marked.  If the event is punctuated by a clear decrease in oxygen saturation followed by a rise or a stabilization, and then a decrease again, two events are marked; otherwise if the event is characterized by one steady progressive fall in desaturation, than one event is scored  ([ResFigure](:pages_path:/mop/6-AA-mop-list-of-illustrations.md) 7f, 7g, 7h, 7i, and 7j).

<u>Periods of hyperventilation followed by long periods of hypoventilation:</u> If periods of hypoventilation have clearly visible beginnings and endings (i.e., are “discrete”) and are associated with at least 2% desaturation, score as hypopneas regardless of their length (they can last up to a few min.). (Note: This is commonly observed in REM.)  ([ResFigure](:pages_path:/mop/6-AA-mop-list-of-illustrations.md) 7k and 7l).
