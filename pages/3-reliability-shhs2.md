# Reliability for SHHS2

**Initial Assessment of SHHS-2 Scorer Reliablilty (reviewed by PSG Committee 4/01)**

The following summarizes part of our quality assurance and certification procedures for scorer
reliability. In early 1995, a formal scoring reliability study was designed (Whitney et al.; Sleep)
which included scoring of20 studies per original scorer (912 {part time scorer}, 914, 915),
scored twice over a 6.5 month interval. Half of these records (IO/scorer) were also scored at the
second time point by the other scorers. A random sample of these records were rescored over the
course of SHHS to document drift over time. It should be noted that these records all came from
the first 500 SHHS 1 studies, and overall, were of poorer quality (especially EEG and oximetry)
than subsequent records. Note that the only scorer who originally participated in the scoring
reliability study who is scoring for SHHS2 is 915. However, scorer 916 joined SHHSI very early
in that study (towards the end ofthe reliability study initiation) and has been involved in SHHS
since then. Scorer 922 joined SHHS2 in November 2000.

### Other quality assurance exercises:
June 2000: Scorers 914, 915, 916 participated in a specific exercise designed to evaluate arousal
reliability in a contemporary data set. 1040 epochs were selected from 40 records. Each record
segment was scored twice by each scorer, within 2 weeks of original scoring. (Note: YY means
that that scorer identified an arousal on given epoch at both time points; YN means she identified
the arousal first time but not second time, etc.)
